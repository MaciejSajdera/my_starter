# Mocks guidelines

**Description:** 
Use always when requested to create mocks. Mocks should only be created inside `src/init/msw/handlers/index.ts` file. 

!!! Check the example file to see how to implement the mocks - `src/init/msw/handlers/examples.ts` !!!

- Always check examples from `src/init/msw/handlers/examples.ts` file and create similar code. Remember to use `http` and `apiBaseUrlConnect` 
- We are using https://mswjs.io/ for creating our mocks.
- Do not create any additional files! All the mocks should be created in `src/init/msw/handlers/index.ts` file
